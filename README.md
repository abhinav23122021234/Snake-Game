# 🐍 Snake Game  

A **classic Snake game** built using **Python's Turtle module**. Control the snake, eat food, and grow while avoiding collisions!  

## 🎮 Gameplay  
- Control the snake using **arrow keys**  
- Eat the **yellow food** to grow longer and increase your score  
- Avoid colliding with **walls** and **your own tail**  
- The game resets when the snake collides with a wall or itself  
- Keep playing to beat your **high score**, which is stored persistently!  

## 📌 Features  
✅ Smooth snake movement using **Turtle graphics**  
✅ **Score tracking** with persistent high score storage  
✅ **Automatic food spawning**  
✅ **Collision detection** for walls and self  
✅ **File handling** for high score storage (`data.txt`)  
✅ **Simple and interactive UI**
